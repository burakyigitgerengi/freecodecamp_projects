Learning Goals & Plan
Here's a structured approach to make it interactive:
Phase 1: Understand the Current Code ✓

Run it and see what happens
Understand each validation rule
Identify what makes a record "invalid"

Phase 2: Add Basic User Interaction
Goal: Let users add a single patient record through input prompts
Steps:

Create a function get_patient_input() that asks for each field
Convert age to integer, medications string to list
Validate the input using your existing function
Add the record if valid, or show errors and let them try again

Phase 3: Build a Menu System
Goal: Create a simple menu for different actions
Options:

Add a new patient record
View all records
Validate all existing records
Exit

Phase 4: Enhanced Features (optional)

Edit existing records
Delete records
Save/load from a file
Search for specific patients
